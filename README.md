This application compares a potential borrower's financial background against a database of lenders and their associated acceptance criteria for approval.  It returns a list of lenders that will accept the borrower's lending criteria.  Additionally, it prompts the user to save the qualifying loan list as a new CSV file, which is a new feature in this update.
